- What's the meaning of
 private[com] def giveRaise(rate: Double)
?

This is using a qualifier. The visibility of the function giveRaise gets fully exposed to the package com._

- Is it useful?

This qualifier makes more sense when the visibility wants to be restricted up to a certain level. In this case,
we're making it global to the com package, so I think it doesn't make much sense, iif everything is contained in com.
